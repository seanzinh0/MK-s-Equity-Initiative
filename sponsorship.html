										“Before I had a sponsor, I felt like life was just something to get through. A lot of kids around me were getting into trouble, and it was easy to feel like that was my only choice, too. But when I was paired with my sponsor, everything started to change. They didn’t just help with school stuff; they talked to me about my dreams, my future, and what I wanted out of life. For the first time, I felt like someone really cared about what happened to me. They’ve helped me set goals, and now I’m even thinking about going to college, something I never imagined before. Having someone believe in me showed me that I could believe in myself, too. I don’t know where I’d be without this support.”

										“I've been watching my family struggle for pretty much ever. I always wanted to do something to help, but I didn’t think college was in the cards for me. Then, I received a sponsor, and suddenly everything seemed possible. Mentors helped me navigate the college application process, new friends were there to cheer me on whenever I felt discouraged. I learned that my dreams aren’t too big and that I deserve a chance to reach for them. Now, I’m about to start studying engineering, something I’d only dreamed of before. My sponsor didn’t just give me a chance, they helped me see that I could create my own future.”

										“I’ve moved around a lot and it felt like I didn’t really have a home, but when my sponsor started helping me, I felt special for the first time. They told me to write down my thoughts and dreams, and that’s when I found out I love writing stories! My sponsor always says that my stories are amazing and that one day, I could be a real author. I’m working on a book now about a girl who goes on adventures, just like I want to one day. Everyday I feel like I make anything, and I want to write books for other kids just like me.”
