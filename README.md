# Mk's Equity Initiative

This project is a responsive website built for a non-profit organization aimed at solving the issue of the sheer amount of improvished youth. The website is designed to raise awareness, offer resources, and engage visitors through various interactive elements.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a modern, responsive website for a non-existent non-profit organization addressing a social justice issue such as homelessness, racial inequality, climate justice, or education access. The site includes features such as educational resources, event information, donation options, and sponsorship and mentorship sign-ups.

This project highlights the team's ability to build a user-friendly, accessible, and responsive site that provides clear and actionable information to a wide range of users.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes with three key breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- **Form Submission and Validation**: A fully functional form that handles user input with client-side validation for email, phone numbers, and other fields, ensuring data integrity.
- **Interactive Components**: Tabs, modals, and scrolling effects are implemented to enhance the user experience.
- **Call to Action**: Pages encourage users to donate, volunteer, or participate in events that support the social justice cause.
- **Accessibility**: The website follows best practices for web accessibility to ensure that it can be used by individuals with various abilities.
- **Multi-Page Navigation**: The website consists of at least 5 linked pages, each serving a specific purpose such as About Us, Events, Get Involved, and Contact.

## Using MaterializeCSS

MaterializeCSS is the front-end framework chosen for this project. It provides a modern and sleek design system, along with a responsive grid, pre-built components, and interactive elements, allowing the team to focus on developing a smooth user experience without reinventing the wheel.

### Why MaterializeCSS?

- **Ease of Use**: MaterializeCSS offers intuitive classes and components that follow Google's Material Design principles, making it easy to implement a visually appealing interface.
- **Responsiveness**: MaterializeCSS includes a built-in responsive grid system that makes it simple to create layouts that automatically adjust to different screen sizes. We took advantage of this feature to design for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints. We also utilized standard media queries in order to have completely responsive web pages.
- **Pre-built Components**: The framework provides ready-to-use components such as modals, tabs, cards, navigation bars, and form elements, allowing for rapid development of the website.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: With MaterializeCSS, interactive elements such as **modals**, **tabs**, and **scrollspy** can be easily implemented using the frameworkâ€™s built-in JavaScript initialization functions.


## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to three breakpoints: mobile, tablet, and desktop, ensuring optimal layout and readability on all devices.
- **Form Validation**: Client-side form validation is implemented to ensure data integrity before submission. This includes error messages for empty fields, invalid phone numbers, and invalid email formats.
- **Interactive UI Components**: Modal popups, tabs, and smooth scrolling provide an engaging user experience.
- **JavaScript-Driven Form Handling**: JavaScript is used to manage form submission, validation, and interactions, with real-time feedback for users.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
* A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox)

1. Clone the repository:
    - `https://github.com/seanzinh0/MK-s-Equity-Initiative`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    - `cd MK-s-Equity-Initiative`
3. Run the project in a live server or open the HTML file in your browser.

### Executing program

1. Open the project in a modern browser:
    - `live-server`
2. Interact with the different pages linked in the navigation.
3. Fill out the form and submit it to see the real-time validation feedback.
4. Adjust your browser window size to test the responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.

## Form Validation

Form validation ensures that the user's input is correct before submission. The website includes:
- **Validation for all input fields**: All forms within the project are will check for the intended data
- **Phone Number Validation**: Ensures the phone number is in a valid 10-digit format.
- **Email Validation**: Validates the presence of certain characters.
- **Empty Field Validation**: Ensures that all fields are filled before submission. Errors are highlighted in red with visible error messages.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Users are given visual feedback for invalid inputs (red icons or error messages) and valid inputs are confirmed similarly.

## Help

If you encounter issues with the form or responsiveness, consider the following:
1. Verify that MaterializeCSS is correctly linked.
2. Ensure the breakpoints are functioning by resizing your browser.
3. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors if the form is not validating correctly.

For troubleshooting, refer to the browser's developer tools for debugging tips.
